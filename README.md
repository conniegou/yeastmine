YeastMine
=========

* Scripts using YeastMine (InterMine) to collect [Saccharomyces Genome Database](www.yeastgenome.org/) data.

* These scripts will work on free [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) accounts because intermine and yeastmine were graciously added to the [Whitelisted sites for free users](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/whitelist/) when I requested. THANKS!


* They do require Intermine module be installed on system!
