YeastMine
=========

* Scripts using [YeastMine](http://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/begin.do) (populated by [SGD](www.yeastgenome.org/) and powered by [InterMine](http://intermine.github.io/intermine.org/)) to collect [Saccharomyces Genome Database](www.yeastgenome.org/) data.

* These scripts will work on free [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) accounts because InterMine and YeastMine were graciously added to the [Whitelisted sites for free users](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/whitelist/) when I requested. THANKS, PythonAnywhere! Of course, they will also work on your computer, server, or cloud instance or wherever you run Python programs that can access the internet.


* Other than the scripts, running them does require Intermine module be installed on system.

Find out more about YeastMine and InterMine [here](http://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/begin.do) and [here](http://intermine.github.io/intermine.org/), respectively.

You can make your own custom [YeastMine](http://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/begin.do) at the [site](http://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/begin.do) by starting with the numerous provided `Templates`, editing them by choosing `Edit Query` button to access the Query builder interface, and then access the code by clicking on the `Python` link down at the bottom middle once you have your built Query. You can edit them further after using Python coding as well.
